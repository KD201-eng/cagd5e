My experiments and solutions to programming tasks from the Book

Curves and Surfaces for GAGD (Computer Aided Geometric Design) by Gerald Farin, 5th Edition

Some of these scripts are expected to be run inside of Blender as I use it as a cheap 3D visualization toolkit.

The datasets come from an personal email from G. Farin. I enquired about the datasets as the two homepages mentioned above
do not seem to carry them anymore. He answered:

   "I don’t seem to have a whole lot. But here it comes…"

Therefore the datasets are likely not complete, but better than nothing.
