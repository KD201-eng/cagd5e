About
=====

This is the repository with my experiments and my solutions to programming
tasks from the book

Curves and Surfaces for GAGD (Computer Aided Geometric Design) by Gerald Farin, 5th Edition

The datasets come from a personal email from G. Farin. I enquired about the
datasets since I couldn't find them on the two pages mentioned above anymore.
He answered:

   I don’t seem to have a whole lot. But here it comes…

Therefore the datasets are likely not complete, but better than nothing. I
also extracted the files that are linked on the homepage in allfiles.txt.

Usage
=====

Most of these scripts are expected to be run inside of Blender_ 2.5 as I use
it as a cheap 3D visualization toolkit. You also need to have the numpy_
library installed and in a way that blender is able to find it. I manually
tweak the sys.path variable for this whenever I start blender.

Related Blog Posts
==================

The blog posts are meant as a standalone documentation about what is presented
in each file so that the code is also interesting without access to the book.
However, the book is much more complete and discusses more than what I am
interested in.
